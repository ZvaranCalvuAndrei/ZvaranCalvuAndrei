- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZvaranCalvuAndrei, full name Razvan Andrei Valcu
- 👀 I’m interested in the less traveled road, freedom, lateral thinking, building an identity platform where small businesses can promote their products and services, and anything related to the DeFi universe. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and Solidity. I am experienced in data analysis, proficient in Excel, slightly better than average in SQL. 
I contributed to (impromptu) various recruiting projects where I identified inconsistencies between claimed and proven skills for candidates regarded as hired, but 
also found genuinely talented people. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on non-tech projects where I can contribute both with my people skills and experience as a data analyst and recruiter or on tech projects 
as a junior programmer. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
